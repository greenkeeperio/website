    <h2>Use <a href="http://semver.org">SemVer</a>. We‚Äôll have your back.</h2>
    <p>The npm ecosystem with its 360,000+ modules is a great foundation to build your software on.</p>
    <p>Using this many modules quickly leads to <strong>a constantly changing platform</strong> and <strong>no way of knowing</strong> what changes and when.</p>

    <p>Until you use <em>Greenkeeper:</em> we track your dependencies and trigger your test suite with every new version coming in. <strong>If a dependency version you‚Äôre relying on breaks your software, we open an Issue</strong>. Find the source of the problem in the attached release notes and commits, or downgrade quickly. <strong>For major upgrades we will send you a Pull Request</strong> directly.</p>

    <h2>Automated dependency management</h2>
    <p>You <em>could</em> manually track updates of your dependencies and test whether things continue to work. This takes <em>a lot of time</em> however and it‚Äôs rarely ever done. So most of the time, <strong>your software is in a Schr√∂dinger state of being potentially broken</strong>, and you have no idea until you run <code>npm install</code> and try the next time.</p>
    <p>Greenkeeper <strong>takes away these chores</strong> of dependency management. <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm test</code> is called immediately after an update. There is no doubt about the state of your software.</p>

    <h3>Free during Beta</h3>
    <p>Greenkeeper is currently free for all repositories on GitHub. It will always stay that way for Open Source Projects. Once GitHub Integrations are out of beta there will be a monthly charge for private repos. Greenkeeper works with npm, GitHub and any CI service. If you want to run Greenkeeper on your own hardware, behind your firewall, <a href="#enterprise">we support that too!</a>

<a id="how-it-works"></a>
<div class="double-flex full-height">
  <section>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Greenkeeper sits between npm and GitHub, observing all of the modules you depend on. When they get updated, your project gets a new branch with that update. Your CI tests kick in, and we watch them to see whether they pass.</p>
    <p>Based on the test results and your current version definition we will send you Pull Requests or open Issues.</p>
    <p>Let the friendly Greenkeeper bot take all the dull work of keeping your dependencies up to date off your shoulders and, optimally, boil it all down to a few clicks. <strong>This is as close to fully automatic as we could possibly make it.</strong></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why it‚Äôs so great</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Staying on top of dependency updates is a lot of cognitive overhead: your code depends on modules that depend on modules. It‚Äôs modules all the way down. Stuff gets updated all the time. It‚Äôll either annoy you, or you‚Äôll miss it.</li>
      <li><strong>Version pinning</strong> would save you the hassle, but you‚Äôll miss bugfixes and new features, and when you do have to update everything in the future, it‚Äôll probably be a huge mess. So let‚Äôs not pin.</li>
      <li><strong>Version ranges</strong> would be nice, but suffer from the fact that SemVer has ‚Ä¶ room for interpretation. Module authors simply make mistakes from time to time.</li>
      <li>You could do all the updates and testing by hand, all the time. But that‚Äôs dull, repetitive work, which is why, let‚Äôs be honest, barely anyone actually does it.</li>
