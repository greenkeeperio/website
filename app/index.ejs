    <h2>Always up-to-date npm dependencies, zero&nbsp;hassle</h2>
    <p>The npm ecosystem with its 300,000+ modules is a great foundation to build your software on.</p>
    <p>Using this many modules quickly leads to <strong>a constantly changing platform</strong> and <strong>no way of knowing</strong> what changes and when.</p>

    <p>Until you use <em>Greenkeeper</em>: it tracks your dependencies and applies an update to a branch for every new version coming in. Your test suite runs <strong>behind the scenes</strong>, and only if a dependency update breaks your software, we let you know in a Pull Request, including all the information you need to <strong>make an informed decision</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Automate your dependency management</h2>
    <p>You could manually track updates of your dependencies, and test whether things continue to work, but that takes a lot of time and is rarely done. Most of the time, <strong>your software is in a Schr√∂dinger state of being potentially broken</strong>, and you have no idea until you look.</p>
    <p>Greenkeeper <strong>takes away the chores</strong> of dependency updates, while <strong>leaving you in charge for any important decisions</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Free for Open Source</h3>
    <p>Greenkeeper is free for public repositories on GitHub. If you want to use it with private repos, there's a monthly charge. <a href="#pricing">Check out our plans and pricing below.</a> Greenkeeper works with npm, GitHub and any CI service. If you want to run Greenkeeper on your own hardware, behind your firewall, <a href="#enterprise">we support that too!</a>

<a id="how-it-works"></a>
<div class="double-flex full-height">
  <section>
    <h2><span class="green">01</span> How it works</h2>
    <p>Greenkeeper sits between npm and GitHub, observing all of the modules you depend on. When they get updated, your project gets a pull request with that update. Your CI tests kick in, and Greenkeeper watches them to see whether they pass. If they do, you can just click the <strong>merge</strong> button, and we'll even auto-close branches for older versions for you. If not, you can use the branch to fix things.</p>
    <p>You‚Äôll be amazed at how many dependency updates you‚Äôve been missing.</p>
    <p>Let the friendly Greenkeeper robot take all the dull work of keeping your dependencies up to date off your shoulders and, optimally, boil it all down to a single click. <strong>This is as close to fully automatic as we could possibly make it.</strong></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why it‚Äôs so great</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Staying on top of dependency updates is a lot of cognitive overhead: your code depends on modules that depend on modules. It's modules all the way down. Stuff gets updated all the time. It‚Äôll either annoy you, or you‚Äôll miss it.</li>
      <li><strong>Version pinning</strong> would save you the hassle, but you‚Äôll miss bugfixes and new features, and when you do have to update everything in the future, it‚Äôll probably be a huge mess. So let‚Äôs not pin.</li>
      <li><strong>Version ranges</strong> would be nice, but suffer from the fact that SemVer has‚Ä¶ room for interpretation, and module authors simply make mistakes from time to time.</li>
      <li>You could do all the updates by hand, all the time. But that‚Äôs dull, repetetive work, which is why, let‚Äôs be honest, barely anyone actually does it.</li>
